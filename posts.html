        Welcome to my new website! I wanted somewhere away from social media to post my bits and pieces, and my aim was to do it as simply and as cheaply as possible. The site is just static HTML and CSS hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, which provides 1GB storage and 100GB monthly bandwidth free of charge, and allows you to push/pull via Git like a regular GitHub repo, so I can edit from anywhere. The only thing I'm paying for at the moment is my domain name, which costs Â£4.65/year from <a href="https://porkbun.com/">Porkbun</a>. It took about a day to set up, including learning the basics of HTML and CSS, which I'd never touched before. In future I might need some fancier static hosting, but for now this setup works great.<br>
        I'm planning on keeping my social media accounts around, but leaving them empty and using them as pointers to this site. I'm keeping the passwords (particularly to Instagram) away from my regular password manager, so the barrier to logging in and scrolling for hours is hopefully much higher.<br>
        At some point I'll get the time to populate my <a href="/photos">photos</a> page with my best photos again, but until then there are a couple other pages you can explore&mdash;inspiration mainly taken from <a href="https://sive.rs/">this site</a> and <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_x6SCSz7g5I">this video</a>.

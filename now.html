    <h3>what I'm up to (as of 15 Feb, 2024)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I’m in my fourth and final year of a masters in engineering at the University of Oxford, specialising in cool heat transfer stuff: specifically, I’m looking at thermal contact resistance at the interface between two rough surfaces, ways in which it can be measured experimentally, and ways in which it can be modelled.</li>
        <li>I’m hoping to stay on for a DPhil in engineering, if all goes well</li>
        <li>I’m treasurer, IT officer, designer of posters, and 2nd violin at the <a href="https://www.oxfordmillenniumorchestra.com">Oxford Millennium Orchestra</a>.</li>
        <li>I play fiddle for <a href="https://www.ouceilidhband.org">Oxford University Ceilidh Band</a> gigs, and am trying to join in with the various folk sessions around Oxford (and hopefully getting better!)</li>
    </ul>
